        [FIXES]
        * Fixed a mind-blowingly dumb bug.  The --all flag would search
          no files at all.

1.00    Wed Dec  7 09:30:25 CST 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added support for finding C programs (--cc)

        * Removed the --only option.  It's now smart enough to know
          that if, for example, you say --perl, you only want Perl stuff,
          and that if you say --noperl, you want everything BUT Perl.

        * Removed the --exec option, which is irrelevant if you use
          xargs like you should.  I added --exec before I understood what
          xargs did.

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.  It's been
        used at FLR for years, but I'm now releasing it in the wild.
